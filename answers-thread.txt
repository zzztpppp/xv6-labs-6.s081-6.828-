1. When two threads are executing the  put function, they may have same hash value and both execute insert. While inserting,
a consecutive operation of *p = e may cause the latter overwrites the former.
A event sequence of such missing keys may be as follows, where thread_1 over writes the inserted values of thread_2
thread_1 -------- e->next = n
thread_2 ---- e->next = n
thread_2 ---- *p = e
thread_1 -------- *p = e
